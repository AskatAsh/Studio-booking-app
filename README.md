## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Filter studios by radius**

- **Challenge:** Geolib npm library was new to me and I faced some issues with calculating the distance and filter studio data.
- **Solution:** Used google and youtube to learn about geolib and also used chrome devtools to handle errors and implement the search feature.

### 2. **Calculating time slots**

- **Challenge:** Based on open and closing time of a studio I tried to calculate time slots with 30 minutes time distance.
- **Solution:** I got to after much research about a function toTimeString() which helped me get close to solving the issue and fully solved the feature using setMinute and getMinute methods.

### 3. **Reseting the inputs**

- **Challenge:** When user clicks reset button in studio list page the search input along with radius select option should set to default values but select option was not reseting.
- **Solution:** It was a simple error but I solved it by using defaultvalue with state and reseting the state when user clicks reset.
